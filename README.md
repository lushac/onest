#### Basic usage

After downloading a web template from Splawr you can run it by opening index.html file (it is located in 'dist' folder) in your favorite browser.

However, if you would like to edit your web template which you downloaded directly from our website you should edit the index.html file in your IDE (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.). To edit how the website looks, just edit stylesheet files that you can find in /CSS folder.

### Using SCSS files instad of CSS

Using SCSS in this project require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Install needed dependencies and run it by typing the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run sass
```

After you edit and save SCSS file Node will automatically render and save CSS file into /dist/css folder.
